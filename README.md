# openHeatTreatment
This repository uses different open sources to analyze heat treatment manufacturing processes.

## Heat treatment
Humans have been applying heat treatment in metalsmithing for thousands of years, from forging kitchen knife to 3m long plane landing gear. 
Now with materials science, computational science, and other disciplines, we can analyze and understand this very old technology in much more details.
